<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Zenawit N. I have a background in Anthropology, Public Health and Data Analysis. I picked up 
  on some free python courses online during the COVID pandemic which piqued my interest to learn more. I have always 
  been curious about how the web functions so that opened even more learning opportunities. </p>

<p>Since then I have been spending time learning different programming languages and working on projects that enhanced 
  my skills. I enrolled myself into a Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp in June 2023 from Tech I.S. and will be done
  by the end of December 2023.
</p>

<p>In addition to the bootcamp classes, I am working on Angela Yu's Web Development course on Udemy to get a better 
   understanding of some concepts and various projects I can showcase. 
</p>
